            It is an information retrieval system that allows information on the Internet to be searched in a hypertext and multimedia environment. It is the most widespread system in the world that effectively searches for various information on the Internet expressed in hypertext format. [1]

Hypertext is displayed in the form of a program called a web browser that reads pieces of information, such as a "document" or Web page, from a web server and outputs it to a computer monitor. The user can then follow the hyperlinks on each page to another document, or send a series of information to the server serving the page. The act of following a hyperlink is often referred to as web surfing or web browsing. A web site is a collection of web pages that contain related content.

While the English word "worldwide" is usually used as a single word without spaces or hyphens, the World Wide Web and its acronym WWW are used as official English words.
